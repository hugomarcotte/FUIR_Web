      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and F. U. I’m Right in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and F. U. I’m Right agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND F. U. I’m Right ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exceptions. Notwithstanding Subsection a, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and F. U. I’m Right will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting F. U. I’m Right.

            Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). F. U. I’m Right’s address for Notice is listed in Section 11. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or F. U. I’m Right may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or F. U. I’m Right shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, F. U. I’m Right shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by F. U. I’m Right in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.

            Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, F. U. I’m Right will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse F. U. I’m Right for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Class Actions. YOU AND F. U. I’m Right AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and F. U. I’m Right agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modifications. In the event that F. U. I’m Right makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to F. U. I’m Right’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to F. U. I’m Right’s address for Notice, in which case your account with F. U. I’m Right shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.

            Enforceability.

            Waiver<br>
            F. U. I’m Right’s failure to require and enforce your compliance with any provision of these Terms does not affect F. U. I’m Right’s right to require and enforce your compliance with that provision in the future. The failure of F. U. I’m Right to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision and a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
